# Cascading ComboBox in the XamDataGrid

This sample demonstrates how to implement cascading ComboBoxes in the xamDataGrid. Cascading ComboBoxes are when the value in one ComboBox is dependent on the selected value in the other ComboBox. A very common scenario for this would be vehicle Make/Model, where when you select a vehicle Make such as Chevrolet in one ComboBox, the available vehicle Models are populated in the other ComboBox.
