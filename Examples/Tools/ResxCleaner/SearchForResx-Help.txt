This tool is used to list the unused resource strings in a "resx" file.

You should pass the following arguments so it can work properly:
 - files, where the tool will be searching for the resource strings
 - location of the "resx" file
 - file to list all resource strings
 - file to list the unused resource strings

Example:

Put the tool in the xamSchedule samples folder:
C:\WORK\xaml-samples\XAML\IGSchedule

Execute the tool with the following arguments:
SearchForResIn.bat Samples\*.* Resources\ScheduleStrings.resx all.txt unused.txt

This arguments will instruct the tool to search all files under the "Samples" folder
for the resource strings specified in the "Resources\ScheduleStrings.resx" file.
The unused resource strings will be put in the "unused.txt" file.
