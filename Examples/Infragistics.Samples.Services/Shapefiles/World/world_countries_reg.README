World Countries Boundary File, World, 2002

This shapefile is a compilation of 2 different sources and has been edited in order to update international changes. It is fairly simplified therefore the geometries are basic. Many of the worlds smaller islands are not included. The original source is DIVA-GIS. Some new shapes were created and some names changed. Then, alternative names and country codes were added to create more joining options. Population and area were joined from the world boundry file from thematicmapping.org.
