Make your data visualizations and dashboards more engaging with a Radial Gauge that shows off KPIs with rich style and interactivity. The round and semi-round gauges are powerful, easy to use, and highly configurable to present dashboards capable of displaying clocks, industrial panels, automotive dashboards, and even aircraft cockpits. This new Radial Gauge (released in Infragistics 13.1) will ultimately replace a previously released version of the xamRadialGauge, and is compatible with the Ignite UI (jQuery/HTML5) and NucliOS (for native iOS) versions of the Radial Gauge, offering visual and functional parity on multiple platforms.

<p>Control the Start and End positions of the scale, major and minor tick marks, labels, color ranges, and sweep direction. You can create full 360 degree scales, or half-circular gauges with 180 degree, 90 degree, or 45 degree scales, or any custom value you want.<br /><a href="/products/WPF/sample/radial-gauge/scale-settings" title="Access the WPF Radial Gauge Fully Configurable Radial Scale sample.">View Sample</a>  </p>

<p>The Radial Gauge control supports animated transitions between configuration states. The control gradually animates as it redraws changes to the needle, needle position, scale range, color range, and more. You can control the speed of the animations by setting the desired Transition Duration.<br /><a href="/products/wpf/sample/radial-gauge/gauge-animation" title="Access the WPF Radial Gauges Motion Framework Animations Support sample.">View Sample</a> </p>
