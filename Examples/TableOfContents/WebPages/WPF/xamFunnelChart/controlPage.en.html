Visually showcase diminishing values with our new funnel chart, a single series chart that displays data in a funnel shape with a variable number of sections, each representing the data as different portions of 100%. The funnel chart makes it easy for end users to illustrate value "fallout" in the sales process or bottlenecks in the flow of a multi-step process.
