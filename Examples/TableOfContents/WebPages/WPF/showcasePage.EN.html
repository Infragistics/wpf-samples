                The IG Outlook showcase application provides guidance on how to build a Microsoft Outlook inspired application
                using Microsoft’s Patterns &amp; Practices Prism library.  This showcase demonstrates the use of common design

                The Map Browser is an interactive application highlighting
                the capabilities of the Infragistics Geographic Map control which allows creation
                of composite maps by plotting geospatial data on imagery tiles from Bing Map, OpenStreetMap,
                CloudMade, ESRI, and MapQuest sources. This application provides data sources of
                all countries of the world, biggest cities in the world, earthquakes, airline traffic
                and precipitation over the United States, and hundreds of thousands of geo-locations
                in Australia. Each data set is visualized using geographic map layer that can be
                edited for appearance as well as overlaid over other map layers plotted in Geographic
                Map control. For example, earthquake locations can be plotted over a map layer with
                locations of biggest cities to provide geographic context for a map visualizing
                how many densely populated places in the world are affected by earthquakes.

                The Finance Dashboard is an interactive application demonstrating the capabilities of Infragistics Data
                Chart and Tree Map controls applied to the Financial Services industry. The Stock Chart view of the
                application is built using the Data Chart, which has been optimized for high speed financial charting.
                The Data Chart supports large datasets with millions of data points and real time updates.  In addition,
                this control enables key statistical and technical indicators as well as comparisons to key competitors.
                Viewing options include 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 5 years, 10 years and “Max” with zoom bar.
                In addition, the comparative analysis charts a company stock price with key competitors. The new Heat
                Map view uses the Treemap and Grid controls to visually represent the current state of the Market in
                a space efficient layout. Real-world applications of this sample may include inclusion into a line-of-business
                application or an external customer facing application.

                slider control.  With both these application views, users can get more detailed information about the
                events like longitude/latitude, time and other scientific data.

                The Equity Trading application highlights the use of Infragistics controls applied to a scenario often
                seen in the Financial Services industry. This application is a basic equity trading platform that covers
                the typical interactions a trader might perform in the course of their work – from using a heat-map
                to review industry and sector performance, browsing real-time stock price data with rich data presentation,
                analyzing historical share price data using highly-interactive charts featuring financial indicators,
                and finally buying and selling equity while viewing charts with plotted stock prices at real-time. This
                functionality is delivered within a flexible layout control called the Tile Manager control, which allows
                the user to resize and arrange the different application modules to suit their workflow and preferences.
                The user can also maximize tiles they would like to focus on, with the rest of the tiles neatly minimized
                on one side. Transitions between tile changes are animated providing a rich and interactive user experience.
