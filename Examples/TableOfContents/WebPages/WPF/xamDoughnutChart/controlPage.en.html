Express your data with multiple series using this rich Doughnut Chart. Similar to a Pie Chart, the Doughnut Chart is used to show categorical statistics expressed in percentages. Yet with its hollow center, it's best for displaying multiple series using concentric rings where each ring represents a data series. Bind easily to data, configure the inner radius, display exploded slices, customize themes, and more with this well-rounded control.

<p>The Doughnut Chart supports one or more rings surrounding a hollow or empty center. The center may either be a "blank circle" or may contain a label. The center does not typically represent data. Each ring can either represent a separate data series that you data-bind to a&#160;data source via the ItemsSource option on each ring.<br /><a title="Access the WPF Doughnut Chart Multiple Rings sample." href="/products/WPF/sample/doughnut-chart/multiple-rings">View Sample</a>&#160; </p>

<div class="feature_row"><div class="large"><h3 class="link"><a href="/products/WPF/sample/doughnut-chart/selection-and-explosion">Slice Selection &amp; Explosion</a></h3>
<p>Allow users to select slices and change the color of selected slices. Exploded slices are disconnected and drawn at a distance from the origin. This distance is controlled via a configurable property. Slices can be selected or exploded either programmatically or using touch and mouse gestures. <br /><a title="Access the WPF Doughnut Chart Slice Selection &amp; Explosion Sample." href="/products/WPF/sample/doughnut-chart/selection-and-explosion">View Sample</a>&#160; </p>

<div class="feature_row"><div class="large"><h3 class="link"><a href="/products/WPF/sample/doughnut-chart/doughnut-chart">"Others" Category</a></h3>
<p>The underlying data for any Doughnut Chart can often contain small value items, too numerous to display in a significant manner via separate slices. For such occasions, the "Others" category allows for automatic aggregation of several data values into a single slice. You can set the threshold to designate which values get their own slice and which values will get rolled under 'Others.' <br /><a title="Access the WPF Doughnut Chart 'Others' Category sample." href="/products/WPF/sample/doughnut-chart/doughnut-chart">View Sample</a>&#160;</p>

<div class="feature_row"><div class="large"><h3>Styling &amp; Themes</h3>
<p>Customize and style the Doughnut Chart to your app design and your brand. Simple properties are exposed to easily style the outlines and brush fill colors of the slices, allowing you to use solid colors as well as gradients. Alternatively, you can use chart themes to give your doughnut charts and other charts a consistent and color-coordinated look and feel. Simply set the theme property to one of the predefined themes or create your own.</p>

<div class="feature_row"><div class="large"><h3 class="link"><a href="/products/WPF/sample/doughnut-chart/hierarchical-series">Legend Support</a></h3>
<p>The Doughnut Chart supports the automatic display of a legend which identifies each series displayed as a data ring, as well as each slice/section within a data ring. The legend can be configured and docked to any of the chart's corners or borders.<br /><a title="Access the WPF Doughnut Chart Legend Support sample." href="/products/WPF/sample/doughnut-chart/hierarchical-series">View Sample</a>&#160; </p>
