Create Microsoft® Word® documents in high-fidelity with the compiled 
assembly that writes in the widely-interoperable DOC/DOCX/WordML file 
format. With absolutely no Word dependency, your application can
 run independently of Word, and Word does not have to be 
installed alongside your application.
