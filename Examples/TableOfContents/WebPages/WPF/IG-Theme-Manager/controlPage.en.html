It has never been easier to apply themes to Infragistics controls. 
    <br />
    Infragistics ThemeManager is a new component that gives you the ability to change the theme of a single control, or an entire application with a single line of code. ThemeManager will change the theme of all Infragistics controls as well as the common Microsoft controls we support.

            You can change the theme of an entire application at design-time or run-time by setting the ThemeManager.ApplicationTheme property.<br /></p>

            <p>You can change or override a theme on a control level by using the ThemeManager.Theme attached property in the XAML markup. To apply the theme to multiple controls in a single view, simply use the ThemeManager.Theme attached property at the root element in the logical tree (the top most parent of the controls).<br />

            <p>ThemeManager supports the most common Microsoft controls and will apply a specified theme to the Microsoft controls. There is a property to turn off this support, just in case you don't want to theme the standard Microsoft controls in your applications.

            <p>You can easily extend Infragistics existing themes by creating a class that derives from a built-in theme class, overriding the ConfigureControlMappings method, and adding custom resources that will be applied when the theme is used by ThemeManager.<br />

            <p>Easily design custom themes by creating a class that derives from ThemeBase, implement the abstract ConfigureControlMappings method, and then provide the necessary resource dictionaries that should be used when applying the theme with ThemeManager.<br />
