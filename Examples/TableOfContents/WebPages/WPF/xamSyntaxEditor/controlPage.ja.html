The xamSyntaxEditor is a powerful text editing control that is used to provide a code editing experience similar to Microsoft’s Visual Studio code editor. It is built on top of our new syntax parsing engine which allows you to apply a set of language specific grammatical rules to highlight both language constructs as well as error information if the text does not conform to the syntax rules of the language.
