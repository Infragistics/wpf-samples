<p>Our new xamSpreadsheet is just a view sitting on top of our existing Excel Framework. Previously customers would interact with Excel documents using code, but now they have an interactive control to create and modify Excel documents. The xamSpreadsheet mimics the look and feel of Microsoft Excel with an interface made up of rows and columns separated by grid lines. Rows and columns can be inserted and deleted, as well as manually resized, auto sized, and hidden/unhidden. The xamSpreadsheet allows end-users to zoom into a document, freeze panes, and split panes as well. The xamSpreadsheet also supports multiple sheets in a single workbook that can be renamed and reordered to fit the end-user needs.<br /><a title="Configuring" href="/products/wpf/sample/spreadsheet/configuring">View Sample</a></p>

<p>The xamSpreadsheet supports in-place editing similar to that of Excel. You can begin editing by pressing F2, double clicking in a cell, or just by typing. As with Excel, once you're editing, you can enter plain text, formatted text, a number, and even formulas. You can enter formulas by using the xamSpreadsheet's formula bar, or by entering text that begins with an "=". Committing your edits is the same as Excel; simply navigate away from the cell or press the enter key. You can also cancel an edit by hitting the escape key.<br /><a title="Editing" href="/products/wpf/sample/spreadsheet/defining-data">View Sample</a></p>

<p>The xamSpreadsheet was meant to mimic Excel as close as possible. Besides visually matching Excel pixel for pixel, it also uses the same keyboard shortcuts that Microsoft Excel uses.  With over 100 supported keyboard shortcuts, we ensure a seamless experience when switching between Microsoft Excel and the xamSpreadsheet. The xamSpreadsheet also provides over 150 commands to let developers create custom menus to invoke a number of actions against an Excel document. With undo/redo built-in, the xamSpreadsheet provides the familiarity of Microsoft Excel, with the power and performance of Infragistics controls.<br /><a title="Selection" href="/products/wpf/sample/spreadsheet/selection">View Sample</a></p>
