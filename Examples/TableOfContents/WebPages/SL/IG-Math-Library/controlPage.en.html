<div class="medium"><h3>Introducing the Math Library</h3>
<p>Access an extensive library of mathematical and statistical structures and functions that you can use with all our Infragistics Professional toolsets. The Math Library provides you with a unified set of core functions that will allow you to perform mathematical calculations that are fast, accurate and memory efficient. Build your own math-driven applications without having to translate your data structures across multiple formats. Employ numerical methods; build compartmental models; perform Monte Carlo simulations; and solve regression problems. </p>

<div class="feature_row"><div class="medium"><h3>An Extensive Core Library</h3>
<p>Our mathematics engine represents a comprehensive selection of math constants, trigonometry functions, matrix objects and other key classes, including Compute Class; Complex Numbers; Constants; Vector Arrays, Matrices and Complex Matrices; Boolean Vectors; and 120+ operation choices.</p>
<!--ul>
<li>Compute Class - An all-purpose class that provides you with access to math functions. </li>
<li>Complex Numbers - These "real and imaginary number parts" are used in many complex analyses.</li>
<li>Constants - A selection that is hard-coded as decimals. </li>
<li>Vector Arrays, Matrices and Complex Matrices - All standard mathematical operations are defined on Vectors and Matrices and, for your benefit; many statistical calculations can be reduced to simple matrix operations.</li>
<li>Boolean Vectors - Boolean values mean that your "compare operators" can be defined on Vectors. </li>
<li>120+ operational choices- Designed to be computationally efficient to speed your development time, this control offers you the correct balance of memory and overhead.</li>
</ul--> </div>

<div class="medium"><h3>Forward Vision</h3>
<p>You will greatly reduce the need to implement common mathematical functions on your own in managing your data grids and charts. The Math Library provides a unified set of static methods which will allow you to perform a large set of operations with ease.</p>

<div class="feature_row"><div class="medium"><h3>Mathematical Intuition</h3>
<p>The Math Library is organized to allow you the ability to extend your "intuition" or thinking past your current mathematical operations and towards sets of mathematical objects that can store data for you more effectively. </p>
