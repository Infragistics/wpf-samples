                The Map Browser is an interactive application highlighting
                the capabilities of the Infragistics Geographic Map control which allows creation
                of composite maps by plotting geospatial data on imagery tiles from Bing Map, OpenStreetMap,
                CloudMade, ESRI, and MapQuest sources. This application provides data sources of
                all countries of the world, biggest cities in the world, earthquakes, airline traffic
                and precipitation over the United States, and hundreds of thousands of geo-locations
                in Australia. Each data set is visualized using geographic map layer that can be
                edited for appearance as well as overlaid over other map layers plotted in Geographic
                Map control. For example, earthquake locations can be plotted over a map layer with
                locations of biggest cities to provide geographic context for a map visualizing
                how many densely populated places in the world are affected by earthquakes.

                The Finance Dashboard is an interactive application demonstrating the capabilities of Infragistics Data
                Chart and Tree Map controls applied to the Financial Services industry. The Stock Chart view of the
                application is built using the Data Chart, which has been optimized for high speed financial charting.
                The Data Chart supports large datasets with millions of data points and real time updates.  In addition,
                this control enables key statistical and technical indicators as well as comparisons to key competitors.
                Viewing options include 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 5 years, 10 years and “Max” with zoom bar.
                In addition, the comparative analysis charts a company stock price with key competitors. The new Heat
                Map view uses the Treemap and Grid controls to visually represent the current state of the Market in
                a space efficient layout. Real-world applications of this sample may include inclusion into a line-of-business
                application or an external customer facing application.

                The Population Explosion application highlights the use of motion framework to animate the bubbles when
                they explode or implode in Data Chart control. With the Infragistics Excel Library, this application
                reads
                an excel file that contains statistical data about world countries and generates a flat data source
                which is later converted to into the hierarchical structure and displayed in the Pivot Grid control.
                Also, there is a two-way synchronization between Pivot Grid and Data Chart. For example, when the Pivot
                Grid control's data changes (by expanding grid rows), the chart is updated, and when the chart changes
                (a bubble on the chart is exploded) the Pivot Grid reflects this change.
