            Inspired by the Microsoft OneNote radial menu, the xamRadialMenu provides a circular menu that orients the commands around the user, rather than requiring the user to negotiate a nested hierarchy of drop downs. Most commonly used as a context menu, the xamRadialMenu allows you to drill down into related sub-menu items with the ability to navigate back to the main level menu item.

            The Syntax Editor is a powerful text editing control that is used to provide a code editing experience similar to Microsoft’s Visual Studio code editor. It is built on top of our Syntax Parsing Engine, which allows you to apply a set of language specific grammatical rules to highlight both language constructs as well as error information if the text does not conform to the syntax rules of the language.
