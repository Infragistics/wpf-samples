        Make your data visualizations and dashboards more engaging with a Linear Gauge that shows off KPIs with rich style and interactivity. The gauges are powerful, easy to use, and highly configurable to present dashboards. This new Linear Gauge will ultimately replace a previously released version of the xamLinearGauge, and is compatible with the Ignite UI (jQuery/HTML5) and NucliOS (for native iOS) versions of the Linear Gauge, offering visual and functional parity on multiple platforms.
